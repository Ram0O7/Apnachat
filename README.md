# ApnaChat

## Description

ApnaChat is a web-based instant chat application designed for quick and private chats or meetups online. Unlike traditional chat applications, ApnaChat does not store messages in a database, making it ideal for temporary and private conversations. Users can join various rooms with their name, and other members in the room will be notified of their presence. While it may not have extended privacy and security features, it showcases the fundamental workings of a chat application, and I'm proud to have developed this project as an individual developer.

## Features

- **Instant Messaging:** Real-time chat functionality without database storage.
- **Multiple Rooms:** Join any room by entering your name.
